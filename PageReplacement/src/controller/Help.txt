-----------------------------------------------Welcome to our application----------------------------------------------

**Note: because the main purpose of this project is 
to help user understand how the algorithm works,
we put some restriction to our application:
  	1. Only non-negative numbers (>=0) are accepted.
  	2. The array size is fixed at 8.


Option menu (on the left of the screen):
* You can:
  	- Choose to either:

    	+ Randomize input.
      
		+ Input your own array in the text field at the bottom of the screen
			The array have to be entered in comma separated form (eg: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
	
	By default, the application will randomize the input array.

Control bar (at the bottom of the screen):
* From left to right:
	- A text field to input your array
  
 	- A "Start" button: 
	if you choose random mode -> the array will be automatically created
	otherwise you have to input in the text field array before.
	
	- An "Run" button: to automatically run the visualization animation.	 
	
	- A "Stop" button to stop running.
	
  	- A "<<" reset button: go back to your initial array.
  
  	- A "<" back button: go back to previous step.
  
  	- A ">" next button: go to next step.
  
  	- A ">>" skip button: to go to the last view (array is sorted).
  
  	- A text area to display the instant step of the algorithm.
